<h2>how to configure your settings</h2>
first make a acount of course then right next to the v-bux store is a friends section.
Now press the button next to it then go into the settings and do what ever you want!!
<h2>how to build</h2>
By default, the building keys are mapped to the function row,
which is way too far out of reach for the average hand.
You can also tap <code>Q</code> to scroll through the building components,
but even that is too slow for Fortnite's chaotic building battles.
Remap the keys based on comfort and component priority.
You'll need walls and ramps at the ready most of the time,
so consider mapping one to Q and another to F (or E, if you're willing to learn a new 'use' key).
Use Z, X, and C or any free mouse buttons for the remaining components, like floors, traps, and pyramids.
Give yourself a few matches to get comfortable,
but you should be able to switch to specific building components as quickly as any weapon.
Experiment until you find a layout that feels natural.
